        -flipping
        -rotating
        -lighting
        -scaling (padding || distortion && no padding)
    
    NETWORK:
        -resnet blocks
        -inception blocks
        -batchnorm
        
    Training:
        -cyclical lr
        -batch growth
        -learning rate warmup (bei scratch train)
        -cosine lr decay (?)
